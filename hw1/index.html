    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello! I am Deniz. I am 20 years old. I am from Turkey. I am an information systems engineering student. I live in Liepaja, Latvia right now. I am an erasmus student at Liepaja University.</p>
    <h2>Last TV Series That I Watched:</h2>
    <h3>Euphoria</h3>
    <p>Everybody knows that Euphoria has a different vibe from the beginning when we compare it with other series. Season 2 was totally disappointing for me. To be honest, it was hard for me to watch the whole season regularly because it was kinda boring. But the final episode was really good. Believe me, we watched the whole season for that episode. I don't want to give spoilers but if you also get bored while watching Euphoria, hold on until the last episode! </p>
